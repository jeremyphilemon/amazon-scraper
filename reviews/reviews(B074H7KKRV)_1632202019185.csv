Having a stomach ulcer isn't fun and this yogurt has made a huge difference. I've tried the expensive name brands and not only are they thinner but many only have 3-4 probiotics, even the yogurts labeled ""probiotic"" yogurt! This has 6 different probiotics and it is thick (for a traditional, non-Greek yogurt) and the taste isn't half bad. My stomach definitely knows the difference too.Studies have shown that eating probiotic yogurt prior to starting antibiotics for H Pylori helps to make them much more effective. And this is the yogurt I prefer and will continue to eat in the future. Thanks 365! You hit the mark with this.",true
