I thought the ingredients and nutritional profile looked great so I bought it. I'm a vegan and I really love vegan foods that others might find lacking or unpalatable. I love fermented foods. I can handle a little funk. But this was honestly just gross, almost rancid tasting. I'm baffled by the positive reviews.",true

Mix with blueberries and granola for a good taste .. add some chia or flaxseed too. Bummed that the past few times WF does not have the larger container or the vanilla. Really hope they are not doing away with this.",false

It is slightly bitter or tart, not enough of something. Not yogurt like taste - should be slightly sour, slightly salty, slightly sweet and umami. But definitely nothing bitter.I ended up adding some stevia and vanilla, and monk fruit, and still it was inedible, the bitterness was overpiwering. I tossed it in the trash. Sadly. As I was so excited to try it.The off taste seemed like from too much almond skin I guess. It is night and day compared to other almond based yogurt on Amazon or the lavva plain one. Won't be buying it again.",true

Well, I tried and immediately questioned how is this even edible?! I couldn’t even swallow a small spoon of this yogurt that taste and smell like rubber. I felt it lodged in my throat and immediately had to grab a large cup of water to get it down. I know non dairy yogurt won’t come close to the real thing but this is a no. Of course, I threw everything away. Thank goodness I didn’t buy the larger tub to try. Never again!",false
