This is a healthy food that doesn't take additional willpower to consume.I used to eat Chobani (regular flavored greek yogurt) each day which contains 9g of added sugar in a 5.3oz portion. 365 days x 9g = 7.25 pounds of sugar a year! I enjoy this yogurt with a variety of fresh and dried fruit, nuts etc. and find it more satisfying than ""fruit on the bottom"". It is also a useful replacement for cream in dishes like Indian food.",false

Yum!","I've never cared for low fat/nonfat dairy. Only organic whole milk/full fat dairy for me. Low fat dairy is plain yucky to me. Terrible taste, no flavor, it's like a watered down version, a shadow of the ""real deal"" if you are used to whole milk. But... I had to switch. At first I just ditched all dairy completely, disappointed because low fat sucks. Tried so many products, all terrible. Well, this yogurt is pretty darn awesome for a non fat yogurt! Actually, it is super delicious and creamy like a dream! I always have a tub... or 5! :D in the fridge. :P Glad I gave it a chance! I can enjoy delicious yogurt again!",true

The taste is unbelievably smooth and delicious and I eat this in copious, slightly alarming quantities. It is my biggest grocery splurge each week and I think it's totally worth it.",true

I love that this one is organic but the best part is its texture. Though I love greek yogurt which is super thick but sometimes it's too thick to mix with protein powder or oats. Wallaby's yogurt tastes so good and super creamy at the same time. So happy that I finally found my go-to.",false

The full fat version is extra creamy, great for baking or as a sour cream substitute.Once you open it there's some separation of liquid from day to day, but you can mix everything in when you use it.",true

Taste like low-fat yogurt because it is creamy.I like to put some berries on top of the yogurt (or a teaspoon of the no-sugar-added strawberry jam) and a little bit of Ceylon cinnamon powder.
