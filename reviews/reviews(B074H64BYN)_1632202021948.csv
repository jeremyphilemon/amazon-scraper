However I recently tried a name brand version of yogurt, and am here to report that unfortunately in this case the name brand version is better (smoother and creamier). I still do occasionally use this yogurt as it is not bad and is very versatile. You can sub it for mayo in alot of recipes (way healthier!), and it is also good in breakfast parfaits and such. There is room for improvement however, and I would also like to see it in a glass jar instead of single use plastic.",true
