Of the Greek yogurts on the market in the U.S., I find this the richest and least acidic at any fat level.At 7oz, it's a bit larger than your typical 5.3 oz greek yogurt container. I use it for making 2-ingredient dough. I mix it with 1 and 1/3 cups (plus a little extra to round off the 1/3 cup) self rising flour. This is a little more flour than some recipes call for, but I find it makes easier to work with.",true

And it is delicious. 0%, 2%, 5% (from whole milk). It tastes more like crème fraiche than like what other manufacturers call ""Greek yogurt"". Excellent source of protein.

Fage is the only yogurt I eat these days, because it's practically the only actual yogurt out there. It's not adulterated with gums, fillers, flavorings, or other, cheaper ingredients. It's not watered down with whey, to increase the volume at the expense of food value.Milk, cream, cultures. That's it. That's all it should be. If your plain yogurt has anything else in it, buy this instead.",true

Not very acidic, just right. Nice mouth feel and uniform texture. Does not separate quickly. Great on fruit, in smoothies, in ranch-style dressings, and in marinades. Great replacement for sour cream in tacos, on borscht, and other recipes. Also good in Indian sauces, if you don’t allow to boil.One of the review factors is “sheerness” but I can’t imagine how that relates to yogurt ;-)",true

Yogurt, she suggested, is a great breakfast or snack option to get protein. Like to mix plain yogurt with a banana and cinnamon for topping. The primary difference between regular yogurt and Greek yogurt is that the Greek yogurt is higher in protein and thicker.I tried this Fage Greek yogurt and loved it. Yogurt is great in fruit smoothies. My favorite recipe: one cup of frozen berries like raspberries-strawberries-blackberries-blueberries mix, with a banana and 1/2 cup Greek plain yogurt with 1/2 seltzer. You can also sneak in some baby spinach, cucumber or romaine lettuce for fresh vegetables and won't notice the taste very much, if at all, if it's under a cup.I also like to cut up a banana and mix it in the yogurt with cinnamon on top. If you go to the Fage website there's a mix of tantalizing recipes using their yogurt such as apple-cinnamon muffins, pumpkin soup, greek yogurt cheesecake with berry compote, and lobster club watercress sandwich.",true
