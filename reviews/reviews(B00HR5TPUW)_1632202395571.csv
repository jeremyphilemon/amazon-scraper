These look like the original packets but when you open them up there is NO writing on the envelopes. I am now stuck with all these boxes of starter I can't use. I am on a special diet and can't ingest some ingredients because of my Ulcerative Colitis. Can't send them back. If you are an SCD diet person don't buy these. Very disappointed in Amazon and this seller.",true
