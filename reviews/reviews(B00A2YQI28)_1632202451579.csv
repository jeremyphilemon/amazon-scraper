It is nice and tangy and creamy. If you want it to be thicker, strain the yogurt in the fridge for 6-8 hours to drain off the extra liquid.Either way, it’s so delicious!Enjoy!",true

The yogurt tastes okay, but the consistency is clotted and unappealing, almost like cottage cheese. I’ve been making yogurt using the same technique for many years so it is not user error. I’m using the same milk from a local farm so it must be the starter. I'm throwing out the remaining packets and returning to yogourmet brand.",true
