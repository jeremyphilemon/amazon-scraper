""Honey Nut Cheerios"" is the #1 brand of Cheerios that are made and it is quite possibly, the #1 breakfast cereal...period!It is simply delicious! It doesn't get soggy unless you let it sit in the bowl forever, (and why would you?) but even then, it's still good and so is the milk after the cereal has been sitting in it.This cereal is great any time of the day or night in my opinion. It is something that I always have in my cupboard.",true
