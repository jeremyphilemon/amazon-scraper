There are several brands of organic milk and I'll buy any them, IMO they're all good, but whenever I'm at Whole Foods I'll ALWAYS pick up a carton or two of 365 organic--to me it tastes just a good as the other brands, but it's ALWAYS much cheaper. Around me, a half gallon of organic milk usually sells for around $5.50, but a half gallon of 365 organic milk is $3.49--can't beat that. Get some.",true
