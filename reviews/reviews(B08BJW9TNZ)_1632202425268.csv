Shake VERY well, that's key to making the consistency drinkable. It's really not that hard.",true

This yogurt has substantial amounts of non-yogurt ingredients, like chicory root. The ""yogurt"" is so thick, it has to be squeezed from the bottle like toothpaste. If you want to get more than half the product out, you need to add water or milk to liquify it.",true
