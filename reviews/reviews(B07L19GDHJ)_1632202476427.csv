Ludewig",1,"Choboni Greek Yogurt","The product itself is very good, the company selling it on Amazon is not very good.IT WAS FIRST DELIVERED TO ME AS A MESS.2 SMALL ICE PACKS THAT WERE MELTED, THE YOGURT HAD EXPLODED, THE COUPLE THAT DID NOT EXPLODE HAD BULGING CONTAINERS. THE COMPANY DID REPLACE THE ORDER, BUT IT TOO ARRIVED IN SAD SHAPE.THIS TIME THERE WERE 3 ICE PACKS, ALL MELTED AND HOT TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE YOGUET ITSELF HAD NOT EXPLODED.ONLY A LITTLE PUFFED UP.I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE CHORE AGAIN OF CONTACTING THE COMPANY AGAIN SO I REFRIGERATED THE YOGURT, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN, AND THE PRODUCT SEEMED TO BE OKAY.JUST HOPE NOBODY GETS SICK FROM INGESTING IT!",true
