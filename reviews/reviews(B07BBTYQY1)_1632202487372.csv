McCarthy",2,"Changed the Recipe???","Something happened...Noosa Lemon was my favorite, but I believe the recipe for this flavor has changed. Has the company changed hands? The lemon used to make me think of lemon curd or lemon meringue pie filling and it was unbelievably good, I mean WOW, GOOD...CALL YOUR FRIEND AT 2AM TO TELL THEM GOOD. No more, very disappointed.",false

I don't like most yogurts because they are usually too thin, have too many bits of food than yogurt which really messes up the food to yogurt ratio. I was in the store an d they were offering samples and just as any rational person would do, I tried it.I happened to try their lemon flavor which I was hesitant about, however, it was amazing, not too light, just the right amount of sweet and the slight hint of tart that a lot of companies have too much of. Immediately I found the aisle and bought two twelve packs of the stuff. (the ones with three kinds of flavors) and I have only bought this yogurt since, it is honestly the best yogurt I have ever had. I wholeheartedly urge you to give this brand a chance, it is great.",false
