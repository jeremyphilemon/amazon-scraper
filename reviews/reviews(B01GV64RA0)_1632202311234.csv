This does not taste like pudding, nor does it taste like bitter, sour milk.In my opinion, this is just right!I think I like this brand slightly better than the other Islandic style yogurt that begins with an ""S"" (which is good too).Like other reviews have mentioned, this particular flavor (Vanilla) is perfect!It truly smells and tastes like what vanilla should smell and taste like and you do see vanilla bean flecks throughout.This yogurt is creamy, smooth and dense without being too heavy.Adding fresh fruit or granola or any other add-ins, almost makes you feel like you are having a rich dessert.I still love ice cream and pudding and other sweet stuff but this is a nice alternative for when you want something sweet but don't want to cheat and have something that isn't good for you.You can even add a little honey or agave if you want it to taste that much better.I just wish this was cheaper but it's still good.",true

It truly is an American thing. I picked this up because I saw that it was icelandic style and didn’t realize it was made with reduced fat milk. It taste chalky with a fake thickness. Please America put full fat dairy on the shelves, you won’t need the artificial thickners. It also is better for you. Full fat dairy delivers an immense amount of nutrition, helps burn fat (fat burns fat) and it is great for your skin and hair.",false
