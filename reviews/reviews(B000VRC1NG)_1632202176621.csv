Fage, 0% Greek Yogurt is the BOMB.First off, it travels well. There is no clotting of the yogurt or breakage of the packaging. The yogurt stays cold thanks to Amazon Fresh methods and comes just like a grocery store would have it.Next, the taste and texture are divine. It is so thick and creamy, and just perfectly tart. It goes perfectly on any savory dish as a sour cream replacement, or on a sweet dish like a thick whipped cream. I love adding frozen berries, vanilla extract, and cocoa powder or stevia to truly make a fabulous yet healthy dessert.No other greek yogurt is as protein-packed, nonfat, and low carb at this one. I have changed thanks to this wonderful FAGE product! YAY FOR FAGE!",true
