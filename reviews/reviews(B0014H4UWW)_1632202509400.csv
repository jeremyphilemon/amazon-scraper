However, Amazon tripled their price last year. Go to the easiyo site to find other US providers.",false

Obesity in the US is absolutely out of control. Its gotten so bad that most of the food companies have now agreed to cut the fat content even with the junk food they produce like candy bars and potato chips. You will start to see these changes rolling out very soon. So it pains me to see something like this. A lot of people will think they are eating healthy by eating Easiyo yogurt as most people assume that yogurt is healthy especially if they are making it themselves. Yet low and behold this yogurt is absolutely LOADED with saturated fat and I do mean loaded. 1 serving of Easiyo Sweet Strawberry has 25% of your daily value of saturated fat and that is only for a serving size of 1 cup. Some flavors of Easiyo are as high as 30% of the daily value. You have a 2 cup serving and your already at 50% for your daily saturated fat levels. To put this in perspective, my favorite yogurt is Breyers and a 1 cup serving of Breyers yogurt has only 1 gram of saturated fat for 5% of your daily value. You will find similar values for Dannon. To put it in a little better perspective, A Big Mac from McDonald's only has 10 grams of saturated fat so 2 cups of this yogurt has as much saturated fat as a BIG MAC. That is nothing short of insane!!Look ill be the first one to admit that this yogurt tastes great. The reason it tastes great is its absolutely loaded with saturated fat. Its pretty much common sense that the more fat something has the better it tastes and the better its texture especially with dairy products. So if you are someone who could care less about the foods they are putting into their body or if your actually looking to gain weight then by all means pig out on some Easiyo. If however you are watching what you eat or trying to lose weight then you should stay as far away from Easiyo as you can. This is basically the most unhealthy yogurt I have ever seen and I have been eating yogurt for over 25 years.Bottom line - Yeah it tastes great then again I am pretty sure dirt would taste great if you mixed it with this much fat. Do yourself a favor and stick with store bought yogurt or learn how to make your own yogurt from scratch, without having to use these Easiyo packets. Its not hard and you can make your batches much healthier than what your getting here. Again society is at a crossroads in regards to the food we are putting in our bodies every day. If nothing is done, the health problems caused from obesity alone will literally bankrupt the US health care system by 2025. This is a fact. Do your body a favor and go with a much healthier brand of yogurt. It may not taste as good but its going to be far better for your body!!",false

The yogurt set perfectly each time per the directions, and is absolutely delicious. Then, I bought 10 additional packets of the strawberry yogurt from this website, and now the third in a row did not set at all. I finally took a close look at the box it came in, and the product expire date was about 6 months before this item was shipped to me. The label shows it was manufactured on April 6 of 2008 and it clearly labels the ""Best Before"" date as April 12 of 2009. I ordered this item in October of 2009. I have CAREFULLY followed directions and have an unacceptable product. I just noticed the outdate on the item yesterday. I am going to try to get a refund! And, if I have to warm milk to a precise temperature and then cool it down to another temperature, it is no longer ""Easiyo"".",true

Has a great flavor.I only wish it weren't so expensive.",false
