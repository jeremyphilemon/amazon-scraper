Now, I use it. I don't use a lot of oil for cooking, but when I do use oil, it's this brand. It's the only olive oil I've ever used. I use butter more often. Sometimes I use a combination of butter and olive oil. I've searched olive oils online, there are MANY, and they can get quite costly. I've read that when buying olive oil, choose an oil that's just from one country, nota combination of countries. I guess if you're that fussy (I'm not)...it's a good idea to research more oils. Use it when cooking, and for salads and dips.",true

I think it is very good value for money & it works well, but the problem is that when I have ordered it through Amazon, I keep getting dented canisters & like any dented can of food, there is not only the possibility that the food/oil might be leaking, but that air might be getting into the can/canister, so I don't know if I can count on the oil lasting or being good for very long. This is the 3rd canister that I've ordered from Amazon and all have arrived dented, so I have to pour all of the oil into another container in order to keep it & be sure that it doesn't leak on the shelf. I am also worried if air is able to get into the canister as this canister was seriously dented & arrived in a plastic outer wrap. I will try another brand, but am starting to think I will have to either just go to the stores in order to buy this or order through a restaurant supply company because Amazon cannot seem to deliver canned goods that are not smashed.",true

I like olive oil, but don't like super strong virgin oils. This is perfect and can be cooked at relatively high heat for sauteing, etc., relative to virgin oils. Metal can packaging is solid, spout works well. My only ""complaint"" is that it doesn't have a secondary open/close air vent to improve pouring. I remedy this by punching a tiny hole on the furthest away from the spout with a sharp knife (cheap serrated steak knife - never use a knife you like for this task, I guess if you want to be technical, should use an awl). Then I cover the hole with some heavy duty tape when I'm not pouring to reduce the chances for rancidification. Suggest storing in a cool, dry place.",true

We sustain ourselves through the 3 liter tin and don't put up with anything else. If you want to spend you money on more expensive oils, please don't let me stop you. The economy needs the money anyway. If you want an oil to cook with everyday this is it. It's not precious or special virgin, the flavor does not overpower the ingredients and is reasonably priced, currently under $30. Buy it, you'll like it",true
