I've tried many, many brands. 1st of all, I only buy organic dairy products (because all the growth hormones and antibiotics and crud they're fed comes out the milk).What I love about the Stonyfield is it always has a nice, thick yet creamy texture and a really good flavor. I stopped buying sugary, fruity yogurt a long time ago and just by plain now. I add a little honey to it and then top with cinnamon fruit and nuts. So healthy for you!Love this yogurt!",true

We don't like Greek yogurt and other brands of regular low fat plain yogurts taste a little too sour. With some nice fruit or berries, nothing else is needed. A great way to enjoy yogurt without excessive sugars added.",true

It has a almost odd taste for yogurt, not bad, but not what I expected. It's more on the sour side, but it worked great for breakfast with cereals or as a snack with fruits. I wouldn't use it for savory meals, like adding to salads as dressing or as a side for taco night.When you store it in the fridge, there is a lot of liquid separation. You need to stir very well each time you use it.Product arrived fresh and in very good conditions.",true
