Finding foods that are gluten free, dairy free, egg free and not full of artificial colors isn't easy. This fits the bill and it tastes decent.",true

No sweetness at all. It's like puffy cardboard. It doesn't even flavor the milk like strawberry. Couldn't finish a bowl.",false

I had liked the taste at the first bite. It taste like a fun strawberry like cereal like when I was a kid, but way healthier. However then that strange grain like after taste kicks in and it’s not good and I can’t get use to it! I Tried it with milk and it’s even worse! So I am going to use it as a dry snack, but I’m not sure if I can get use that weird after taste, but I really don’t want to throw it out. It’s not a chemical taste like some had suggested, it’s more like a grain, bark like taste, that just doesn’t go at all. I’ll assume that after taste is in all the different flavors. I would say to not to bother, it’s not worth it, I promise.",true

In my head,I even thought ""Cardboard has more flavor than this""....And I'm PREGNANT. I can pretty much smell flavoring from across the room.Haha. I understand they are very healthy. I have eaten my fair share of health foods, as I am an Autoimmune sufferer and have to stay away from traditional fair.... but Holy Hell. No.This cereal is so bad that once this box is choked down,I won't even buy from the rest of the Forager line of cereals.It is also WAY over priced;you only get 6 servings to a box and the box it's self isn't really that big to begin with.No, no, and no in my book.Don't waste your money.",true

It seriously tastes like captain crunch, and the texture is just about as rough, lolMuch better flavor than the cinnamon version, in my book",true

The flavor wasn't all that either. A bit like cardboard.",true
