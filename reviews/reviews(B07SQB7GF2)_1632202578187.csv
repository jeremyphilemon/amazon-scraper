I would have a serving after a very low carb breakfast that had greatas my low carb numbers in the past many times we’re confirmed by checking my blood sugars religiously for 30 years and know exactly what cause me to go hi and low . I searched the web to see if I were the only person having much higher than the nutritional values show and found I wasn’t alone at all . There was a verifiedstudy of many low carb cereals effect in blood sugars and sadly Catalina crunch came in at the worst of all tested well known brands. Sooooo be careful and watch your blood sugars when either eating with other low carb foods or more than a small serving by itself .",true

Tastes okay, obviously not like real cereal and it has a strong sugar-substitute taste, but I don't mind it. HOWEVER it's interesting to me that this is marketed as being keto but I still need to use insulin for it - without it, my blood sugar would still rise significantly, so I'd be interested to see how people on a keto or low-carb diet are affected by it.",false
