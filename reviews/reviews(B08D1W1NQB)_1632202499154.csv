Both those cravings are satisfied with this granola. Whether eaten alone, with yogurt or a little almond milk this is a sweet treat I’m grateful to have. A mixture of nuts without all the additives. I’m also grateful that it doesn’t have that mentholated aftertaste that done keto snacks have. I would highly recommend!",true

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the serving size is tinnnyyyyy so if you eat a normal amount you're actually kind of getting a lot of carbs. Everything in moderation I suppose",false

Because it is a delicious granola when its fresh but the bag I bought from Livlo on Amazon was rancid tasting. It has an expiration date of Dec. 2021, so it should have been good. You can even smell the rancidity when you open the bag.Not sure I can risk it to buy any more of this granola. Really a shame cause it tastes great and has healthy ingredients for someone on a low carb/keto type diet.[UPDATE] 8/26/21I contacted the company and they sent me a new bag of the product which was fresh and delicious. Hopefully, my continued purchases will be just as good.",true
