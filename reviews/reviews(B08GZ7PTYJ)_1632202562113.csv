D",1,"Disappointing","I was excited to try this, the flavor and packaging seemed very promising. It was not good. It smelled vinegary and the texture was off. I have enjoyed other types of non-dairy yogurt before. I bought it in person, it’s a 10 minute walk home, and the best by date is in March. The kindest thing I can say about this product is perhaps there is a quality control issue. I wouldn’t buy it again.",false

I am justifying it now as I keep the jars to store beads and crafts. I would buy more and keep buying if it was less expensive, especially compared to all of the other yogurts and dairy free options. It is way more money. I like the flavor combos, which is why I buy it.",false
