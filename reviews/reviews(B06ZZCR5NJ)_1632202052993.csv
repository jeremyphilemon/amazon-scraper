Iâ€™m super disappointed with this product. 5/6 yogurts Iâ€™ve bought have had mold.

This product isnâ€™t worth purchasing until they fix the problem. Itâ€™s a shame.",false

Reminds me of consistency of Milk Of Magnesia. So Gross. I do not recommend this product at all.I really am not that fussy, but this is just disgusting. It said Dark chocolate coconut. It was the color of tan with no chocolate tasting at all or even coconut for that matter. Save your money don't buy it or better yet get Fage now thats a delicious yogurt. I will never experiment again. Staying with what is delicious.",false
