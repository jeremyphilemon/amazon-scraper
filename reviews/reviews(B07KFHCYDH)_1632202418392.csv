The yogurt is very creamy and decadent with swell cultured and sweet taste. My only qualm is that when I bring it to work (often in a lunch box with an ice pack) it gets too creamy and loses its structure even after being in my lunchbox for an hour. I end up having more of a yogurt soup than a semi solid snack. Regardless, I give their flavors a 5/5, but the stability of the yogurt lacks when packed.",true
