Fage is one of two I've found. The other is Chobani. Other than that, I would not buy yogurt due to the unhealthy ingredients. This Fage Greek yogurt is both tasty and healthy. What more could one want?",true

Normally on sale around $5.60","Fage has excellent flavor and texture and HAS NO THCKENERS.Many so-called Greek yogurts are not thickened by straining the yogurt, but by adding thickeners.Fage list price is around $7.60, but it is normally always 'on sale' for around $5.60.Most American yogurts are in a 32 oz quart container.Fage is in a 35.3 oz container. This is the European 1000 grams which is almost 10% more yogurt than in the American quart container. Side note: I fell in love with Greek yogurt when living on Crete many decades ago doing research.On Crete, back then,the yogurt had a much higher fat content, which I would not want now.For me, the Fage non-fat yogurt is very creamy and satisfying.",true

It is very versatile - - can be a substitute for mayo or sour cream. Put some lemon zest in this mess and slap it on a pita with hummus. Or, add some sriracha and put it on the burrito of your choice. Delightful with fruit and/or honey. Pour some sugar on it (a la Def Leppard).",true

Least worst case involves - it's gross. I don't want to describe it. But it's survivable and kind of funny.Worst worst case is bilestones. It's like a gallbladder attack, but you don't have a gallbladder so you think you are dying. So painful.So no more whoopee pies for me.Which brings me to yogurt. I hate most fat free options. They have thickeners and whatnot. Fage is just made with good quality milk, heated carefully so that it doesn't get grainy or too sour, and strained to the consistency of cheese.So good.No side effects.",true
