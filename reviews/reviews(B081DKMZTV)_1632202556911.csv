The problem is that it's hardly affordable, especially if you have an entire family that loves them too ... It's over $50 just for a week of yogurt and heaven forbid you eat two containers a night. For the average family, it's just not practical to purchase regularly but we do still purchase it as a special treat.",true

The yogurt itself tastes luxurious compared to other vanilla yogurt I’ve tried. It is pretty light, neutral and non acidic in taste. It does have added sugar but it’s not too sweet like some other yogurts with added sugar. It will go well with so many toppings. It’s pricey, but worth a try if you’re curious. I would stock up on some if it goes on sale.",false
