Van Meter",5,"The new Kite Hill is beyond legit","Kite Hill was really good before but it was expensive. The new Kite Hill... idk what they did to the recipe but I'd go vegan for this stuff if I wasn't already. It's better than anything out there --dairy, almond, soy -- you name it, Kite Hill yogurt has it beat in flavor and texture. I use it for everything now.The size is big enough that the price difference isn't as bad as I first thought. Idk if that was the case before or if the new recipe makes it more worth it but it seems like I'm getting more than I used to, at least with this yogurt (they make all kinds of things).",true

Now contains corn starch.","Let me start out by stating, we've been buying Kite Hill yogurts for a few years now (only brand on the market we've found that we could eat without allergens , until now), and absolutely loved the unsweetened plain yogurt, could use it in baking, sauce making, just about anything you could think of, also great by itself!Sadly, Kite Hill has changed their recipe to using a Corn derived Starch*, and I can no longer buy this yogurt, as I and my family have a strong allergy to Corn and its derivatives.( We can and will continue to buy the Greek yogurts as that has tapioca starch which is not a problem for me, but its not at all the same flavor nor texture as the plain yogurt so I can't use it in the same ways).*I called Kite Hill as soon as I saw the ""now creamier"" logo on the side, and saw it listed an unspecified Starch in the ingredients. After waiting a week for Ryan at Kite Hill to call me back, he was able found out from the product team what form of starch was used, he was able to inform me that it was indeed (what I feared) Corn Starch. Ryan said he will be sharing with the team my concern, as I shared that I will no longer be able to buy the product now, after buying two a week for the last year and a half, as it was the only yogurt available.as of Jan 2021",false

However, I've had to return 2-3 out of every 10 purchases because certain batches have a chemical flavor that is just hard to get past. And the new creamy texture version, which seems to be the new standard, tastes terrible! (I could care less about having a thicker yogurt; it's now too thick and gummy - the old one was perfect). I'm so sad to say I will have to stop buying this. This went from being a delicious yogurt I ate daily to just plain gross. Please, Kite Hill, return to the old flavor and make it consistent throughout all your batches and you may regain a loyal customer!",true

Kite Hill has changed the nutritional facts on this item. It is no longer 2g net carb per serving. It is now much high (6g net carbs). I have been buying this yogurt for the past year and just assumed it was always the same. Then I noticed this morning! Huge change. I called customer service from KH and they said that they do change ingredients at times and do not update the website. She assured me this was not mislabeled and is the current info. Such a bummer. I really enjoyed this on my keto plan.",true
