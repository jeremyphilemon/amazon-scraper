I mixed it with a can of full fat coconut milk and let it ferment for 3 days (covered with a napkin, whisked periodically). That new batch of yogurt is much better, and now I can use that for starter (and probably only have to wait 2 days for a new ferment).I would rate this 3 stars as a yogurt, but 4, maybe even 5 stars, as a starter.",true

It seems to be a constant issue with this company. I contacted the company probably 4 to 5 times in less then a year. You would think they would have fixed the issue by now. Just so disappointed because they taste really good but it has become a hassle to store the moldy yogurt until the next time I can get to the store for a refund.",false
