I was very happy to find this drinkable cashew milk non-dairy yogurt. Each bottle has 3-4 servings. Its a great pick-me-up mid-morning or mid-day. The flavor is good, just like high quality yogurt. It also comes in single serving bottles. It contains all the probiotics I look for in yogurt. Smaller cartons just like regular yogurt are also available. Of all the nondairy yogurts - almond milk, coconut milk, oat milk, etc, this cashew milk yogurt comes the closest in taste and texture to regular yogurt. Definitely recommended.",true

I like Mango but I'd say it's only 4/5 as far as mangos go. Blackberry is also like 4/5 as it's a bit too tart for a drink though I love blackberry pie.If you can get the strawberry or blueberry you definitely should grab one.",true

Calcium pills have too many unhealthy byproducts and I don't like dairy so I wasn't getting enough probiotics because I don't eat yogurt. This solves both those problems. It's drinkable, and plant based, with one billion of probiotics per serving. Also organic, which is a plus and different flavors to choose from. But the word is out and sometimes these are sold out.
