The thickness and texture was pretty good if you like the standard store bought variety. I didn't like the tartness of this one though. I strained it twice which greatly improved it. That got rid of much of the tartness and created a super thick Greek style texture the first strain. Straining 2nd time created a rich cream cheese texture, so that was cool! I did not add anything to sweeten/flavor it so I will try it again in the future and it might be more appealing to make regularly. I wanted something different so Itried and fell in love with a Bulgarian culture so I have only been making that ever since. If you want something most Americans are used to (boring in my opinion) then this is it, but I would encourage you to explore beyond this basic variety. There are way better cultures waiting to excite your tastebuds!",true
