Marchesani",5,"Absolutely Great Tasting","Superb taste.This is the best yogurt I've tasted in the US.In fact, it's better than most yogurt I ate during seven years in Europe.The artificial ingredients in the ordinary super market ""low fat"" cheapimitations can't be that healthy and the taste is mediocre.If I couldn't get this product from my local grocery store, I'd get it here, BUT the shipping costs are exorbitant.",false
