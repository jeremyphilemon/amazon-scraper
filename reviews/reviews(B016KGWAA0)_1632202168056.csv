However, I immediately put them in the fridge to enjoy later. I love coconut so I was excited to try this brand but was super turned off by the watery flavor that did not taste like coconut at all. I drank two and let my husband drink the rest. I will never buy again or recommend to anyone else. The price is too steep, the cans way too small and the taste not special enough.",true
