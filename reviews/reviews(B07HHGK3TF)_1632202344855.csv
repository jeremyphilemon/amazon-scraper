I ordered 3 organic pineapples and 4 days later while attempting to cut/core discovered all 3 had mold on the inside & in the outside skin. I'm beyond disgusted considering how much consumers have confidence that we're paying for & getting the quality in produce. This rotten produce also had a distinct foul odor.Never again will I allow Whole Foods to select/deliver my fresh foods & produce",true
