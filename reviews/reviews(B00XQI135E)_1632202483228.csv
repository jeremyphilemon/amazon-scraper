Drees",2,"Didn't Really Work","It really did not work.I made the yogurt per directions and got milk that was somewhat thicker (like a runny custard) and had a tang of yogurt flavor.Was terribly disappointed and being as it was my first try making yogurt, I was afraid I didn't do something right.So, I did round 2, same sloppy stuff.Then I got a small cup of yogurt from the grocery and tried everything the same way, and bingo, I got yogurt (good yogurt too).I won't say it didn't culture (hence 2 stars), but it really didn't do anything near what it was supposed to.",true

I tried several different brands/types. The first batch took about 8hrs, and each batch since takes about 3hrs to set. My results are using whole milk in an instant pot and at an altitude of just over 6,000' (I've heard that can alter setting times.) It tastes good, just a little bit of a tang which is perfect for us. Straining it produced a really thick yogurt with more of the tart tang, for those who prefer that.",true
