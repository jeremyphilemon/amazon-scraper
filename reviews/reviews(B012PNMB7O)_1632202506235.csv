I never got any four to work. I used unsweetened almond almond milk with one packet, 2 times and it failed both times,I tried it with soy milk and it was liquid yogurt and the 4th I tried with coconut milk and it was smelly milk.I was told this would work in my instant pot and it failed. I’m annoyed and I wasted money, and I can’t return. Not a happy buyer.",true
