Advantages with their yogurt: best tasting we have ever tried (having eaten yogurt over many years and many brands). Milk: excellent. Best of all: the origin of their products is one dairy. Not any slew of dairies. To add to the benefits, they are a coop and support environmentalism. They welcome visits and keep up with their customers via email in a welcoming, helpful way. The only sad part: they're trying to compete with trends. Nevertheless they remain solid with real food.",true
