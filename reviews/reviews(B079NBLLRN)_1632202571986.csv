This particular flavor was ok, I personally don’t like the taste of stevia, so although I wanted to love this one as much as the plain, I prefer the plain which doesn’t have anything else but coconut and live cultures. If it had no stevia in it or sweetener for that matter I would have given it 5 stars.",true

It has a slight sour taste with stevia notes at first, BUT don't let that deter you. Because once your tastebuds wake up - the sheer, creamy coconut taste will take over. It is a delish VEGAN creamy yoghurt without all the bad stuff. The aftertaste though got me, it's like someone has awaken all the senses!This yoghurt is very filling, it took me a few days to finish it.The price is a little steep as with most vegan option products, so I buy this maybe 2x a months. But it's worth it, like a little decadent treat in yoghurt form!",true

That some reviews say it’s a little greedy that’s because it’s from young tight coconuts and this is the smoothest consistency that I have tasted myself.I have tried to grind up young Thai coconuts at home and I could not get the smooth consistency at home myself. The vanilla flavor is the best flavor compared to the plain coconut flavor. I like this flavor I like the taste I like mixing it with berries. It is a tiny bit grainy but it won’t stop me from buying this again. Yes it is six dollars a jar and yes it will expire on the expiration date it is because of the probiotics that are in here that make it expire.",false

Opened it to try it, not too bad tasting but had a weird lumpy texture. Had about two spoonfuls. Put it in the bottom of the refrigerator (the cold part) for a week while I finished up my other yogurt. Took it out tonight for a snack and it had fermented so badly that it burned my tongue and I had to spit it out. Printed expiration date was 1/13/21 but it had gone bad as of 12/21/20. Except for the two spoonfuls, it was a full tub. Six dollars shot to hell!",false

There has to be at least a little over a tsp left in the jar that you can’t get out with a spoon. If you use your finger possibly but that is disgusting. I hope they change this jar to make it easier to actually get all of it out. $6 is a lot when you can’t eat the whole thing . The jar can also be more compact and different shape. There is another Brand that doesn’t taste as good but has much better glass jars .",true

I love everything about the plain one so much and love vanilla but this one was so off. The texture is clumpy not creamy like the plain one, the vanilla taste is weird, it’s like they add monk fruit or stevia to it but it’s not listed as so.Not a fan at all and would not purchase again. I will continue to just mix vanilla in with the plain.",true

It's pricey, but Cocoyo is the single greatest nondairy yogurt I've ever tasted: thick, creamy, tart with fermentation, naturally sweet. (Really, I'm describing yogurt.)
