I eat it almost daily and just don't get sick of it. I like the regular Vanilla one by this brand too, but the extra creamy version is my favorite.The only issue I can find is the packaging can be kind of delicate, especially if being delivered. I have had to request refund many times for these where there was a hole punctured in the top by something, or the packaging is coming unwrapped from around the bottom part of the yogurt container, creating a space for air to get in and for it to spoil. Or, because the packaging is almost like a thick paper rather than plastic, I have also received a few where there are dark spots on the outside of the packaging due to the yogurt leaking through.So, check yours carefully when you receive it because these issues are unfortunately pretty common. I will still buy it because it's absolutely delicious but the packaging could use some work for sure.",true

The krimi Skyr is honestly better than ice cream for flavor and it’s a healthy breakfast and snack item full of healthy milk fats, protein, pro biotics and actual vanilla beans. Makes my mouth and tummy happy! I am not a fan of tradition yogurt as I don’t like the strong tangy flavor, Skyr does not have that, it’s a slightly sweet, creamy, delightfully flavored fairy delight. I buy both Siggi’s and I Icelandic Provisions, Siggi’s has been around for several years longer than Icelandic Provisions and is a wonderful product but I really like Icelandic Provisions flavors more overall. Haven’t had a flavor I don’t like, even the coffee one was good and I really do not like coffee! The vanilla is my #1 favorite followed by the Strawberry Lingonberry, tied in third are Cherry Blackcurrant and Peach Cloudberry (I’m not typically a fan of peach) but ss",true

The bulk of the yogurt bands on the shelf are Greek (biggest shelf offender, Chobani, y'all know that already), which I hate. Its too bitter and lumpy, personally don't like large pieces of fruit in my yogurt. My favorite use to be YoPlait Thick and Creamy until they thought it was a good idea to discontinue it. Very few brands have tried to fill that void. Until these guys. Great quality yogurt that isn't overly and sometimes gag worthy sweet, and also doesn't take away from the health benefits that is eating yogurt.Icelandic Provisions is one of 3 yogurt brands I swear by right now as quality, thick and rich in flavor and and healthy. The others are Siggi's, another Skyr brand, and for a more rich sweet and possible dessert like brand La Fermière, a french yogurt. I've tried Oui by yoplait as well and it is for another review but I simply say only vanila. The Key Lime for example the ""fruit jello bottom thing"" was weird to be found under yogurt that isn't meant to be stirred. Eat it and you will underatand. Specifically for Icelandic Provisions: cloudberry peach, vanilla, vanilla bean, and black cherry currant are my favorite. They also have a lemon and cold brew coffee flavor that aren't half bad. Highly recommend you try them as well as the others.Icelandic Provisions and Siggi's are why it is possible to eat yogurt daily for me.",true

I wish they'd put it in glass jars like Yoplait Oui (this is much better than the Yoplait Oui vanilla), especially since it's $2 each which is a bit steep for a tiny 4 ounce yogurt. It's sooooooo yummy, though. Super thick, like sour cream (which is why I don't like the lemon Krimi Skyr bc it feels like you're eating... sour cream). I wish Amazon sold these, or Whole Foods grocery delivery would start accepting EBT, whichever.",true
