That being said, true biscotti, they aren’t. If you’re looking for a crunchy, twice-baked treat to dunk into your coffee, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. One dunk and these will disintegrate into your coffee or tea. They aren’t crunchy in the least, but you can easily remedy this by quickly baking them again in your own oven if you don’t mind going through the trouble. They taste so good that the fact that they have the incorrect texture doesn’t bother me one iota, though. I did deduct one star due to this issue, but I will still buy them. I find them to be quite an enjoyable indulgence!",false
