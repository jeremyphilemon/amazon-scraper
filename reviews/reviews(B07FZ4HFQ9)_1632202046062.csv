The best stuff ever. If you are looking for:- high protein (relative to other products)- like the thick style of ""yogurt""- enjoy taste over HFCS sweetners- not afraid of words like Skyr- think that heirloom cultures are fabulousThen this is for you. Personally, I don't mind if you don't buy any because that keeps some on the shelf for me. All flavours are delicious. If you want to test your taste buds, vanilla is much better and tasty than you are thinking; amazing is a word that fits, in my mind.",false
