I have achalasia, and getting food down can be difficult. This works fine. Other flavors are too acidic, but the peach cloudberry is both delicious and doesn't hurt/burn my esophagus. I've recommended this to fellow achalasia sufferers. Whether or not you have achalasia, this is the BEST SKYR! Highly recommend.",true

This has a bit more creaminess that 0% fat greek yogurt, which makes it feel more luxurious, and I think the tiny bit of fat (2 g) balances out the tartness that low fat yogurt often has, but I can only taste the tiniest amount of peach, and I can only assume a cloudberry is some sort of berry mist that floats above my spoon. It's non-existent in this yogurt.There are tons of better tasting yogurts out there, with better macros, that cost much less.",true
