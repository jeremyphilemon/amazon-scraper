Once according to the directions on the package, once according to my yogurt maker instruction. Yogurt didn't set in the 4-5 hours it said in the package. One hour more and it was sour, curdled, and inedible. It's not worth wasting more time and milk. I'm going back to store bought yogurt for starter.",true

(btw, if you haven’t discovered Nido Fortificada, put a can in your pantry.It’s great and keeps a long time.)I like a rich yogurt, so I always use whole milk, and I've even added some cream to the milk when I want to make frozen yogurt (basically just putting flavored yogurt in my ice cream machine).So far I've made 10 batches, and every one was delicious.No failures so far and you can't beat that.You can get a really nice, thick yogurt without it getting too tangy.To this point I've used the starter for every batch instead of using the heritage method, since cost is not a factor.This way I get finished yogurt in 5-6 hours of cooking with another hour of straining.It is my understanding that it will take a few hours longer if using a previous batch to start a new one.Be sure to heat your milk to 180* first and let it cool to the 100-115* range before adding the starter. This step isn’t required, but it makes the yogurt creamier. 100-115* is the optimum temp, although the little critters will work fine within a 10* range either way. Temp mostly affects how long you need to incubate.It takes 140-150* to kill them altogether.Please mark this review as helpful if it has been, it helps others see it too.",true

Damghani",2,"UNRELIABLE","I discovered this brand, first at Himalayan Institute PA. The yogurt is tangy ( how everyone outside United States, believes the yogurt should be) and Smooth. So good that I had to go to the kitchen and ask what starter they use. I ordered it and for a whole year, I had the most amazing yogurt. Easy, economical, tart, perfect consistency. Much btter than The European Yogurt you buy at Trader Joe's.I ordered it again the next year from the same Amazon distributor. Not a single one in the package worked! And I hopelessly tried to experiment with increasing the incubation time, the cooling time, mixing two packagage... Not a single one worked. I feel that if there was a possibility to buy the product from the company itself rather than Amazon, the issue could have been resolved. But it is not possible. Or... Is it just an unreliable company? I am very disappointed.",true

Since I didn’t have a starter or sample yogurt that I can start, I ordered this item. Directions states 1 pack for a liter of milk but it’s not enough I guess, because there was not any change at all. Starts as milk, the finish product is spoiled milk. I used three packs in 1 liter, it worked but it was too sour. I tried to use the yogurt itself to make the next batch but it did not work at all. The result is I’m still buying my yogurt from the grocery store. I just cannot make it work.",true

But a little runny.When I use the store bought Greek yogurt, for example, it comes out more creamy.This results are after letting it (incubate) for 10 hours. Maybe if you would let it go longer you could achieve a stronger taste and a creamier yogurt.However the taste and aroma of the yogurt is great.I have also used a cheese cloth to drain out the whey which makes it better but still can't achieve the texture of what my wife and son like.So will keep trying and may update my review in the future.",true
