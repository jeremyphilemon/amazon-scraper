It was pretty tiring to check all the labels of all the yogurts out there and even many organic ones do contain those things that I would rather not have in my body.Here is the ingredients list of this yougurt and this is why I like itno JUNK!Just your milk, cream, fruits, cane sugar!!! yes, cane NOT Corn Syrup., fruit pectin that is a good thingand lemon juice and then a ton of all good bacteria... all you need is here: and nothing else!Pasteurized Skim Milk, Pasteurized Cream, Black Cherries, Cane Sugar, Fruit Pectin, Lemon Juice, Live Active Cultures Live Active Cultures: S.

The flavor is delicious, and the consistency is just right. It is a bit on the expensive side, but worth it to me. The only reason I rated it 4 stars rather than 5, is that the Vanilla is the better flavor!",true
