My husband and my 1yr old are both allergic to milk protein (casein allergy). Alternatives like Soy aren’t ideal due to the hormones, and almond milk and coconut milk don’t have enough nutrients for a growing child. The pediatrician recommended Ripple milk to us due to the calcium, good fats, and protein in it as we wean my daughter off of formula. It’s been fantastic, and she absolutely loves it. My husband does as well and uses it in his cereal. Very pleased with it. Note that it’s not sweet like other milk alternatives can sometimes be, it definitely not bitter, but it’s not sweet. Also like that it is creamy. Definitely recommend it!",true

Better blended with other stuff since it's not sweeten, but better than a lot of things unsweetened. Still tastes sweet, but not the sweetest. It's thick. You can only tell when consuming it alone. That's why it's better recommend to blend. Great to blend with Mocha teas & fruits.",true

It tasted really good. It was fresh too. I was really surprised by the taste, that it was this good. I’ve seen it in the grocery stores, but always passed it by, cos I wasn’t sure about it. So I decided to finally give it a try. But I can’t really and honestly tell the difference between this and regular chocolate milk.Tastes the same to me. Well… needless to say, from now on, I’ll be buying this from time to time. Highly recommend!",true
