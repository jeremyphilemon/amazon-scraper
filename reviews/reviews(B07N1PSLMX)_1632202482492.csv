From the flavor (pleasantly tart just like regular yogurt) to the texture (pro tip, whisk it in a bowl or give it a vigorous stir in the jar before eating), this is without question and by a mile the best vegan yogurt out there. No weird gloopy texture, no plastic taste. Delicious and creamy. Pricey? Yes. But worth it for anyone who misses yogurt and can’t or chooses not to eat dairy. Buy it!!",true

It reminds me a lot of desserts I ate while growing up in Eastern Europe. My bf who does not believe non-dairy desserts can be as good as the “original” ones, loves it too! Just a note for people who prefer their yogurts to be sweet – Culina adds much less sugar than competitor brands. It’s a huge benefit for me, but I can see how some people may be disappointed.",false

I love a thick yogurt. This is IT! This stuff is so delicious topped with granola! The bourbon vanilla is my fave. It’s become a mainstay in our refrigerator, replacing my evening sweet-tooth run for ice cream(thank goodness!). Highly recommended.

Why you should buy it: better texture than other non-dairy yogurts with terrific choices of flavor. The plain yogurt can be used as a base for making dipping sauces including for satays or other meals. Excellent on its own or in smoothies or as a base for desserts. It doesn't have cheap fillers, great for those who like to eat clean, especially with food allergies. Packaged in glass and paper and not plastic.",true
