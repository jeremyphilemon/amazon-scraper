I don't know what I was expecting since it's made with oat milk ðŸ˜… I love this brand tho their oat milk and chocolate oat milk are super good and go really well with coffee. So, I'm giving this 4 stars even tho I don't like it because if oat and little sugar is your jam you're gonna love it. My husband loved it. Oh and btw! It's really creamy. I hope this helps ðŸ’–",true

I decided to purchase this on a whim due to it being on sale and was not disappointed. At first glance and dip of one spoon, it definitely is runny. Still, after I mixed its contents due to it all being at the bottom ( as expected ), the consistency got thicker, obviously more flavorful, and the color changed.I ate it plain the first time and added nuts and the brand Ding Dong Coconut flake the next time, and it made it even more enjoyable of a snack to eat. I'm not one to eat solely healthy food, so having this in my rotation now makes my mind, and I'm sure my body feels good due to the benefits of yogurt.Give it a try, and please don't let the negative reviews sway you as you may be surprised, and NO, I'm not a sponsored or paid review. You can check out my profile to confirm for yourself since I definitely dish out my fair share of negative reviews myself.",true

The yoghurt was soo runny, it was like soup. I know non-dairy yoghurts are thin but this was like water. It was also incredibly sweet- even my son wouldn't eat it. Two bites and it went into the trash. I'll stick to their milk and ice cream and leave the yoghurt alone.",true

It was a little too gooey, like the chemicals they added to thicken the oat milk just wasn't doing its job subtly enough to pass as yogurt. Surely there are other milk-alternative yogurts on the market that are better.",true
