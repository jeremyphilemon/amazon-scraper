At all!It has a consistency of pudding, considering the loads of pectin and starch that is what happens.Yogurt producers, the ones that are of good quality, will not use starch and pectin. Go to any grocery store and check for 99 cent yogurts, you will find pectin in almost all. The lower quality items (even for 99 cent) might use starch as well.Check the high quality yogurts ( I am not talking about the pricy ones, even the ones for half the price of this one), will have 2 simple ingredients. Milk and Cultures.Why do cheap yogurt producers use pectin and starch? In order to significantly cut down from the amount of milk need to produce yogurt.Yogurt is supposed to be something healthy, and if you put starch in it, than you cut down the benefits of milk.For this price, I would expect nothing but milk and cultures.Cutting down health benefits andusing low quality items aside, neither the taste nor consistency was not even as good as 99 cent yogurts.PS. I love goat milk, cheese and yogurt, so do not think that I did not like it because of goat milk.",false
