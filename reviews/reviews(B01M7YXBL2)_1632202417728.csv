They are pricier than when I could buy at the grocery but it’s worth the extra money for me as protein bars that everyone loves are hard to find.",true

I have been looking for these for a while,was surprised to find them here. These are a well balanced with protein, fat and carbs.

",2,"Alright","They were really hard to chew & they were not fresh. I have ate the Peanut Butter ones for years & tried a new flavor but wasn’t WOW’d by them. Had they not been so difficult to chew I would have probably ate them eventually but I did pack them for my husband who will eat anything (but he loves the PB ones and eats them everyday for breakfast on his way to base.) I packed this flavor for him & he usually tells me at night if he doesn’t want a specific item in his lunches again but for these he sent me a message and said never pack them bars again if we don’t have PB just don’t pack those bars!",true

I tasted one without looking and thought that tasted weird, then took a good look at it - it is discolored and misshapen, and if it had melted and reformed. Opened all 3 boxes, and the same is true for all the bars. I don't know if this is a factory problem, or Amazon stored them incorrectly (it is not hot here, and they did not sit on my doorstep), but they are inedible and disgusting. Amazon refunded but i won't be buying them again anytime soon",true
