It is extremely creamy and you feel guilty when you're eating it even though it's not unhealthy. The consistency and taste is fantastic. I usually take some fruit and agave syrup and put it on the yogurt and it's amazing. I buy the 2% most of the time but the fat free and 5% are also good. I highly suggest this product",true
