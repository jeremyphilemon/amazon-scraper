York",4,"Good dairy substitute","I bought this to try after I couldnâ€™t get the CoYo brand I normally do. Itâ€™s very thick and tastes ok. Iâ€™ve gotten the plain and Bourbon vanilla before. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of coconut but itâ€™s not a strong coconut flavor. The texture is more like custard than yogurt. Quite thick. I normally use it to make overnight oats and they turn out very well with this yogurt.",true

However, when I found this diary free coconut milk yogurt I fell in love!I was very skeptical at first about how it would taste.Surprisingly it tastes and has the texture of a good thick, tart, Greek yogurt.The price is a bit steep but quality products usually are...I purchased the unsweetened plain and it has become my favorite after dinner treat.I mix it with frozen fruit and a bit of grain free, sugar free granola and it makes the perfect yogurt parfait.It is quite a bit more expensive than I like but when you need a good Greek style dairy free yogurt this one is the one I recommend.",true

No sugar , Greek style and dairy free , great probiotics.....since I nurse and my daughter cannot have dairy it is so difficult to find a yogurt with low or no sugar and with probiotics with good taste .this yogurt is so close to Greek yogurt itâ€™s unbelievable!

Better than non-vegan yogurt. I use this plain flavor in a veganized recipe for black bottom cupcakes (the kind with the cream cheese middle). Works great. The packaging is awesomeâ€¦..I commend the company for selling their product in nice, plain jars that I can reuse. I love the other flavors, as well. In particular, the vanilla is very decadent.The plain is also good with either fruit or chocolate chips stirred in.",true

I personally donâ€™t love it plain but donâ€™t want the sugar either so I add stevia and vanilla collagen with some nuts and it ends up being a good little parfait. The only grievance I have with it is that it isnâ€™t consistent by container- some more liquid, some with a strong coconut flavor, others not. All in all itâ€™s good though and Iâ€™d recommend.",true
