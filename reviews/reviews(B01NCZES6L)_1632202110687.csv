I’ve learned to purchase Shea Moisture shampoos & conditioners that list the “fragrance” near the end of the ingredient list, rather than near the top, as then the scent is not as strong.I purchased this one after looking at the ingredient list that is posted. Unfortunately when I received the bottle, I saw the ingredient list here is different than the one on the bottle. And as I suspected after smelling the conditioner, the ingredient list has fragrance as one of the top ingredients.I’ve emailed the company before, and even though their ingredient lists say the fragrance is an “essential oil blend,” it is actually a blend of fragrance with essential oils. So for those who are sensitive to fragrance, this is important to know.",true
"R2DI97LMJJZFTS","B01NCZES6L","","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","December 1, 2020",1606806000,"K Nichole",5,"Works really well as an ""everyday"" conditioner","So, the reason I put ""everyday"" in parenthesis is because I don't wash mine or my daughter's hair everyday. lol However, when I do, this conditioner works really well on her (my daughter's) long, curly hair. Her hair is like a 3a/b curl pattern and it's on the fine side so while I do like to use a deep conditioner at least once every few weeks, I don't like to use them every single time I washher hair because i feel it is a bit too much/heavy for her hair imo. This works great on her hair. I've had good luck with shea moisture products on her hair. It's one of my go-tos. I prefer shea moisture over Cantu products any day. The Cantu products are awful and drying on her hair. If you've been using Cantu products and are still struggling with dryness and stuff, I'd recommend trying out shea moisture instead.",false
