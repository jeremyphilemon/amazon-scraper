Smooth as silk, and a little milder than many plain varieties. I like to put chunks of fresh pineapple in it, and it’s a much better sour cream substitute for potatoes, Mexican food, or mixing in than any other premium brand that I know of. I eat it plain, it’s that wonderful.",true

It certainly has it's fans and I can certainly see why. I picked it up from a local grocer and had some as an afternoon snack with blackberries, unsalted mixed nuts and (don't knock it 'till you try it) Friendly Fire Guava + Habanero hot sauce. Man is it good, and mostly healthy to boot! It helps keep hunger at bay for a few hours and I get a decent serving of protein.I appreciate the 2nd layer under the foil seal that keeps any air from getting to the yogurt. It has a very creamy texture and more distinct flavor than say, Chobani. It is a combination of sour cream and cream cheese, but a little more mild. It could easily stand in for either of those and would make a great base for a dip.Made in the USA and sourced from dairy farms in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut where the cows not administered added hormones.~ Kort",false
