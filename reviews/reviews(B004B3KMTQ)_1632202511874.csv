This was ultra rich and is a great source of protein. It's made out of whole milk for calcium. I use mainly to make smoothies but because this tastes tart and pasty, it doesn't taste as good with certain combination like vegi. But with fruits, it breaks it up a little. It‚Äôs a big 32 oz container and will last for weeks. And eventually, it will get watery but that's normal. Not a bad overallfor a yogurt.",true
