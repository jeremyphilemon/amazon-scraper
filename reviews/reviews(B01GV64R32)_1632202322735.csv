I felt like I was eating bland cream cheese to be honest. I really wanted to like it. Might be good if you add real strawberries to it. Wouldn't reach for this again.",true

Skyr or otherwise. It is of course not yogurt or Traditional Skyr because neither one of those have Pectin or Locust Bean Gum in them. Having been to Iceland I can tell you if this was served at the table, at first bite it would be thrown into the nearest lava flow .If the grainy texture of some form of window putty with a bit of flavor in it appeals to you go for this ....If you want some Icelandic labeled yogurt that is true to its name get Siggis which does not have the offending Pectin or Locust Bean Gum, tastes good and can legitimately be called smooth.Use this stuff to putty your windows or spackle your walls ...",false
