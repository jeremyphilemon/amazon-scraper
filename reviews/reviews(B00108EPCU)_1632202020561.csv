"R1VIWUS094WO7O","B00108EPCU","","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2021","June 16, 2021",1623823200,"Jackie",5,"As long as they keep it at $3.99, I‚Äôll continue to buy it!","Love this yogurt and the fact that it is probiotic! It‚Äôs plain but it‚Äôs good. Not too sour and a fairly thick consistency. Water continues to drain from the yogurt as it sits but I just mix it in. If you don‚Äôt like it, pour it out and enjoy the thicker more greek like yogurt core.Right from the beginning of shopping with Amazon Fresh, I was struggling to find a good yogurt for my gut health that was within budget and had a hard time until I came across this. It‚Äôs even organic! Even at $3.99, it‚Äôs worth it for the amount you get over individual servings.It‚Äôs versatile! Did you know you can sub this into recipes that call for a ton of sour cream or mayonnaise? I wouldn‚Äôt replace the entire called amount for the recipe but even if you are only subbing half, it‚Äôs quite a bit better for you and in cold recipes, you‚Äôll benefit from the probiotics. Warmer days means more tuna and egg salad. That‚Äôs way too much mayonnaise for my waistline so I‚Äôve been subbing about 75% yogurt. Mind you, you should work up to this amount because it does change the flavor a but I personally got used to it.My favorite breakfast yogurt right now is adding a handful of frozen mango chunks, some chia seeds and superfood powder then topped with sliced almonds. On occasion, I drizzle honey over it. Some days, I‚Äôll just mix in fresh blueberries and a little bit of sweetener. Super ripe peaches, honey and almond is really good too!Anyway, it‚Äôs a great base product with the benefits of probiotics. If you make yogurt like I do sometimes, this will work as a great starter too. I have more Instant Pot‚Äôs than I‚Äôd like to admit to owning but they are always in use so I don‚Äôt get to make yogurt often enough to cycle the last batch. Rather than buying cultures, I just go with a good organic plain yogurt because cultures are expensive and this way, you will have some ready to use while your Instant Pot is doing its thing.",true
