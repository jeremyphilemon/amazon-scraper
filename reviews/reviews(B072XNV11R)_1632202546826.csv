The key lime yogurt truly reminds you of key lime pie. It's also great for those who cannot have real key lime pie due to the ingredients. It's a wonderful change from the standard flavors you tend to see on the shelf in non-dairy yogurts.",true

I thought the lime and coconut flavor would match well, but I could barely bring myself to eat it. Very sad, because key lime chobani was my favorite flavor back in the days of dairy yogurt. The texture of this coconut yogurt is okay, but it's not worth the calories, especially with how low on protein it is. It's basically sugar and fat and funky lime tang.",true

It has a great consistency that is just like a dairy yogurt which is nice, because sometimes vegan yogurts are super thin and watery. I will repurchase this flavor and try more by this company!",true
