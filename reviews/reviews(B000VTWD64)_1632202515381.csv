But the Fage 0% tastes very much like sour cream. When you use it for dips or dressings, you really can't tell the difference. That means you can have a whole container of dip with 0 fat!!!!! Or a salad dripping with dressing with 0 fat!! And since it's greek yogurt, its less creamy and has a consistency much like sour cream. Everyone who has tasted dips that I've made can't believe it's not sour cream.",true
