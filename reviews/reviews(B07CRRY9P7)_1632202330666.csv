Very tangy, will try 2% milk next- so much better than store bought",true

I purchased this a few months ago along with a yogurt machine. Followed all the instructions exactly as stated and ended up with just watery mix. I wasted gallons of milk thinking maybe the machine is bad or the temperature is not exactly right etc. nothing worked. I returned the yogurt maker. Of course this is non-refundable. It sat in my cabinet. I decided to try again and purchased another yogurt maker with great reviews. Tried again with one of these packets. Just watery mix. This time instead of returning the yogurt maker, I purchased full fat organic plain yogurt and tried it with the new yogurt maker last night(used 4 tbsp of yogurt to 1 quart of cow’s milk). Woke up today to perfect yogurt. So the culprit is this culture. Gallons of milk wasted. And I could have been eating awesome healthy homemade yogurt all this time if not for this.",true

One time a complete watery mess and the other two not edible. I've used an actual fresh plain yogurt several times with great success so I can only assume that these cultures are dead or simply no good. I've followed the directions precisely and used my instant pot twice and stove top once with the same results. When using a live culture yogurt I've had no problems. Your results may vary.",true

I mix in one packet per 1 litre of warm milk as the instructions say. It takes 8 hours for the machine I use and a couple more hours chilling in the fridge.
