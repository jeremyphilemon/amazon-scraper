"R2IIUKIADLJBY4","B07FM5NPZ3","","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020","June 20, 2020",1592632800,"Pamela",5,"This is really special.","I adore the plain sky as a generous condiment with cold fish, whether the fish was smoked, dried, cured or cooked at home. It’s really special. Sometimes I mix it with peanut butter and chopped walnuts to enjoy with a cup of coffee for breakfast. Be creative. Fruit is so obvious, but the fruit flavors might be nice with the peanut butter, which actually mixes very well. This skyr has a lovely texture and density and the flavor is still mild, not sharp. I haven’t tried it in hot dishes, but I plan to use it as a substitute for Greek yogurt in a quick bread recipe with olives and cheese. I might float a dollop on my next bowl of hot soup. It couldeven add substance to a cold gazpacho this summer.Idk!;)Cultured milk products are supposed to be better for us than milk and cream.",true

Both the plain and flavored options have a superior smoothness, creaminess and overall flavor.Love the plain with a sprinkle of berries, or as a base for a smoothie.It's great in place of greek yogurt in recipes, if you don't mind losing a little of the extreme tanginess of greek yogurt. I prefer the subtle sweetness of this skyr.",true
