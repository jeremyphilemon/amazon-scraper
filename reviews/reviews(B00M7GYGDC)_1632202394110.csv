I usually buy these in the store and have bought on Amazon before as well. But every bag in this shipment contains tiny little crumbs of banana bites rather than the normal bite size ones. It makes them annoying to eat as a snack (but would probably be ok as a topping to something). Haven‚Äôt had this problem before but this box is a waste of $$ for me.",true

When we opened the bag, it was one giant squishy melted lump of goo. We stuck the entire bag in the refrigerator and are now shaving bits off with a knife.Now that they have been melted and refrigerated the temper is broke, so the taste/consistence is off as a result. This is probably a shipping problem rather than a product problem but it does make me leery of ording them again.",true
