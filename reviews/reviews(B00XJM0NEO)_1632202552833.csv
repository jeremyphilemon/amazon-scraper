I bought the 5 pack and immediately tried making a batch using the provided instructions, 1 qt. of whole milk, boiled, cool down, temp check via temp probe, then incubation for 12 hours. What I got was a touch of curd at the bottom of one of jars I checked. Leaving it for another 4 hours did nothing.I tried a 2nd batch with whole milk but no boil and used the microwave to get the milk to temp so I could add the culture. This batch I left for 16 hours and had not set up at all, no curd, nothing.The 3rd try I boiled whole milk, cooled down, and left it to incubate for 24 hours. Nothing but milk.I may not have made yogurt a lot but I have made it a few times and have never had a total failure, let alone 3 in a row. I left the incubator to sit, didn't shake, or move it, boiled, no boil, whole milk - homogenized. I have no idea what's wrong other than maybe this item got too hot in shipping? Going with a different brand and see how that goes.",true

This one ended up quite bland for my liking. On top of that, I ended up with mold on top of almost half of my jars which is something that has never happened to me before. The only thing different with this latest batch of yogurt was this new culture. Definitely won't be buying this product again and will be sticking with the Icelandic culture I've been using without fail. I was definitely disappointed in this product.",true

I have previously used the Bulgarian and the Pure Acidophilus with very good results. I had a good experience with this one as well. The directions were clear and easy to follow. I incubated the yogurt in a yogurt maker for about 12 hours- it did take a long time for the yogurt to thicken, but the directions said that would likely be the case the first time. I have not yet tried making a second batch using the first batch as starter. This first batch has a good taste. It's thick and slightly tart. I'm hoping subsequent batches using the already made yogurt as starter will result in an even tarter yogurt. I'm pleased with my purchase and with this brand/company. I look forward to trying some of their other starters. I purchased the Bifido along with the Balkan-style, but I have not tried it yet.",true

You can use a spoon of yogurt or sour cream and you'll get the same effect. And once you have made your yogurt once, you can just use that yogurt as future starter.",false
