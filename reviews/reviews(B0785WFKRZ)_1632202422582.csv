The Yogurt is pretty good, even tastes like Ice Cream a bit in which I had seen someone write in their review and it's true to a point. The Yogurt is full of flavor with some chunks of fruit and best off all, tastes natural. I will be purchasing this again when finished with what I currently have.",true

A. This tastes like strawberry ice cream, and who doesn't love that? B. The consistency is key. it doesn't get watery like other greek yogurts do day after day once you've opened them. C. No frozen/unfrozen strawberry chunks. I like my greek yogurts to have a smooth consistency because I add fresh fruit, or chocolate chips to mine, and often times, I find that the fruit pieces that are in greek yogurt, just don't taste very good because obviously, they're frozen. To anyone who is skeptical or picky, GET THIS IMMEDIATELY! It's like dessert for breakfast.",true
