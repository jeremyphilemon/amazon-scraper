These are fast-dissolving capsules taken 2 per day, so a 120-cap bottle is good for 2 months. Reasonably priced, and no funky smell or burp/taste. It is not easy to find affordable probiotics with this assortment of bacteria, so 5 stars for sure.",false

Be aware that the bottle states to refrigerate after opening, which I did not because my usual brand and others I have tried did not require refrigeration. The capsules are large-ish, but easy to swallow. Taking a two-capsule dose is working ok, but not quite as well as the one-pearl dose of my usual brand.",false

My stomach doesn't feel better after consuming, it feels worse. The pills are large and seem to upset my stomach.I'm not getting the gut improvements I get with other brands.I don't know the reasons why. Is it the milk ingredients? Is it the quality? Is it the freshness? No idea. I just know this supplement doesn't agree with me and I'm not seeing gut improvement.",false
