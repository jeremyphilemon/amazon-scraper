The texture is richer, more flavorful without any jam, the jams are delicious, all of them, and a cup is very satisfying especially considering the cost. Yes this is a rave, and I do not ever do that. For those who do not know, Greek yogurt is very healthy, and contains lots of good dairy protein, which is good for you. Want to be healthy? Drink a lot of whole milk. Watch your cholesterol drop down.",true
