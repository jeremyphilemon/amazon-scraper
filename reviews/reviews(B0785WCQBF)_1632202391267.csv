Try mixing with plain low-fat dairy kefir!","I love this Greek yogurt, but it's made from whole milk, so it's pretty high in fat. To lower the fat and also make it less thick, I mix it with low fat plain dairy kefir, like this Lifeway kefir: https://www.amazon.com/Lifeway-Organic-Low-Kefir-Plain/dp/B000QJC5KI/ref=sr_1_1_0o_wf?dchild=1&keywords=kefir+plain+fat+free&qid=1621282298&sr=8-1. The yogurt-kefir mixture tastes great and contains even more different strains of probiotic bacteria than the yogurt alone, because the kefir provides lots of additional strains of probiotic bacteria!",true
