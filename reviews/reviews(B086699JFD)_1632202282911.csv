But like most Keto items, this one is also very expensive for what you get. The bag is quite small. And the portion size is quite small (1/4 cup). I eat it as a snack and a way to satisfy my need for some crunch. But it's a long way from being a meal, even with milk added. 5 stars for taste. But I took away one star because of the high cost.",true
