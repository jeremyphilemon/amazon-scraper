I use these to mix with my protein powder after working out and they are perfect. I love the taste of Very Vanilla and unfortunately I cannot find that flavor in store so I buy on here. After using Very Vanilla no other flavor tastes as good so I'm sticking with this one. The containers are super convenient as they are 8 oz each so I don't have to measure them out just mix them with my protein powder.",true
