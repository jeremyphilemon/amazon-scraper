I normally buy the 2% but it isn't always available so this one does the trick. I don't eat milk products but after always taking expensive probiotics, I use this because of the live cultures and it does the trick, it doesn't really cause digestion problems as a person with lactose problems which is a plus. It's my go to for my tummy. I don't have it all of the time, but will really use it after antibiotics for a few days. Very thick which I love, I do not like thin and runny yogurts, so I add a bit of sugar or fruit but never sweeten it too much because I love the sour flavor too.",true
