Super heavy and feels like heavy sour cream.Not my thing to begin with but I give four start for good ingredients and caring, however not organic so not five stars.I can not stand Greek yogurts because they are too heavy. I prefer normal yogurts that are easier to digest andare not as bulky.This particular yogurt is brutally calories packed compared to other ones that are plain non greek style but are also organic.If you compare this yogurt that packs 230 calories in8 oz serving toStonyfield organic that has160 calories in8 oz serving orStonyfield Organic Plain Lowfat Yogurtthat has 110 calories in the same serving sizeor any other NON GREEK NON STRAINED type thenit is really mind blowing how heavy and fat packed this one is.I know that many people out there seek the fat content and the protein content so that might be right for you.However if you are in the calorie control group that seek filling yogurt without overpacking in fat thenthose other options might be better choice.I bought it once to try and I am not going to come back to this particular style, if they will offer NON Greek,plain yogurt and ORGANIC then I will be happy to revisit.",false

Enjoy as is or as starter!","I made my yogurt from scratch and this is the only brand which delivers results perfectly as a starter! Also prooves it has no additives and is a real deal!In case you want to make yogurt from scratch here is a quick tip ( internet must be full of them too). Boil the milk, let is cool down to the temperature of 95-110F where a pinky finger ( washed and clean of course) just feel warm. Add a teaspoon of your starter yogurt, and leave it overnight. If you live in colder climate, do how you would proof a bread overnight ( breadproof option in oven/covered with hot wet towel in microwave or in oven with light on). Next morning keep it in fridge to set or if you making sour yougurt for a recipe, leave it be for some more time..You can use the yogurt again for next batch. ( I have upto 8 times when I am lucky!)No additives, no funky preservatives, gelatin or stickiness as if contaminated by some fungi. (I read microbiology as my major). This is the only yogurt I would use as is, or as a starter. Hope you'll try homemade yogurt from Siggi. Feel free to ask if any questions..",true
