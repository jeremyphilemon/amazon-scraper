Thank you","Two weeks early and not a moment too soon!I love the Easiyo system sooo much!The packets are $$ but the yogurt produced is not just easy, it is WONDERFUL!!!There are lots of alternative recipes for the easiyo packets if you read the comments on the easiyo yogurt maker or any of the packets.Whatever you use, it’s going to be good!!!I’m extremely happy to have stumbled onto this yogurt method, but it works and tastes 'oh, so good'!Easiyo has a new fan.And the seller got the package to me in great time, too.",true
