Rowe",5,"Best nondaiiry yogurt culture I've found so far.","I get spectacular results with this culture for making soy yogurt.I use organic soy milk that has nothing in it but soybeans and water (I buy Pacific, but there are other brands out there), and I get really nice yogurt. I just warm the milk to 108F (I have a digital thermometer from my breadmaking) then stir in the culture.I pour it into a mason jar, put the lid on, and set it in my furnace closet for about 12 hours, where it stays at about 85 degrees.A yogurt maker probably would work also.Perfect every time, nice flavor.The whey drains off nicely to make a thicker Greek style, too (using a cheesecloth-lined colander).Photo is the latest Greek-style (hung) soy yogurt that is currently in my fridge.",true

I used it to make yogurt with shelf stable Westsoy Unsweetened Plain Soymilk, and it worked great. I used a quart of the soymilk, and a little less than 1/8th teaspoon of this starter. Put the starter in the quart of soymilk, shook it up, poured it into my yogurt maker, and 12 hours later, I had perfect yogurt. Next time I will try using even less, maybe 1/16th tsp.I keep this starter in the fridge to make sure it stays fresh. The bottle is small, but you use such a small amount that the bottle will last a long time. This is the best value I've seen for vegan yogurt starter. Would not hesitate to recommend this.",true

Very little comes in the bottle. I understand “a little goes a long way” but come on, really?I won’t purchase again. The yogurt starter comes in a container the size of a small baby aspirin bottle. The label claims the contents makes up to 15 gallons of vegan yogurt but for what you get for the price it’s just way too expensive for me. I will not be buying this yogurt starter in the future. I’ll spend my money elsewhere. There are several other reputable vegan yogurt starters out there that give you way more bang for your buck.",true
