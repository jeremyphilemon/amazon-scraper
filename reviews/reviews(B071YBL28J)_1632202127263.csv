And when I put my spoon in the container, no no no, the yogurt is pretty watery and liquidy, my spoon runs all the way to the bottom of the container, it does not have certain consistency as regular traditional yogurt. On the next following day, when I opened it again, the whey(creamy colored liquid) runs off from the yogurt body.Uhhh!!! Just go and pick other brand of yogurt.",true

It has je ne sais quoi flavor and texture. Yogurt has become really thick, which I usually love, but this thinner texture, tangy, but not sour flavor - it's really unlike any other yogurt I've ever had. I literally order WF delivery just to get this yogurt, and it's fairly priced.",true

I buy yogurt as a semi-filling snack; I added a lot of fruits and granola to give this more texture, but it's like eating from a bowl of milk. If you're looking for something much thicker I would recommend Siggi's (it is also more tart though).",true

It was lemony and relatively thick, and very expensive for a very small container. Now the yogurt sells in large containers for a lower price ‚Ä¶but the yogurt doesn't have the lemon flavor, or any sort of vanilla flavor, and it is extremely runny, without the creamy top it once had. I will never buy it again. (Note: it has not been available in my neighborhood upscale natural food store for a couple years, but it is now available in supermarkets like Albertsons. This company completely changed their product. So sad.",false

This is too thick to be called a drink, too thin to eat with a spoon. Kind of like a Kefir I guess, it is a thin milkshake and I was very disappointed in that. I guess others calls this European Style? Whatever I am sticking with Siggi's Icelandic, or organic Greek yogurt any brand.Hopefully the grass fed cow products will pick up just as organic did over time",true
