By far, this is the top of the probably 15-20 different brands they sell. It is creamy, and the maple flavor is not too sweet. It is like eating ice cream. Honestly, I love this yogurt. It is the only brand I now buy. I love this topped with muesli and fresh berries. I love the layer of thick yogurt cream on the top. Ethereal!!!!",true

I was hooked. I ate a lot of it to the point where my body smelled like Maple Syrup. I really thought I had a disease. It took about four days not to smell like the yoghurt anymore, after I went cold turkey on it. It's crazy, but the Brown Cow yogurt flavors are the next best thing to a wedding cake flavor. Creamy, rich and really addictive. It gives Chobani a good competition. I haven't had this good of a yogurt, since I left Germany. Germany has the best varieties, and I'm happy that I tried this out (now I'm eating a little less of it,lol), and it helps to substitute it from far away. Best yogurt taste ever!",true

But this was too sweet, and I found there is added sugar beyond the maple syrup! Why would this be necessary?A small serving left me feeling like WAY too many pancakes on Sunday morning.Also, to my surprise, after one serving, and going back to the opened container, the place was aswim in a watery soup which didn’t seem like the usual whey that collects in yogurt normally. It was as though the yogurt was dissolving, and quickly. I bought two big containers, and this was happening in both.That said, we did manage to eat it all, and it was okay.",true
