It almost tastes like ice cream compared to other brands and flavors. Not too sweet, less fermented taste than most! I like also the higher protein.

With added whipped cream this is a spectacular treat. My ""go-to"" of the Icelandic Skyr, to the point even when not on sale I tend to order at least one of this flavor (but none of the other ones, for they aren't worthy).",true
