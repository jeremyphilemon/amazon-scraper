He threw up less than 1h after having 5 baby spoons of it. It was the first time he ever threw up and I felt terrible for him. At first, after this happened, I thought he was lactose intolerant, but a couple days after I had one of the left over yogurts and this time I threw up after 1 hour. I wonder if it went bad during transportation or if sometime before it got to my address it spent too much time out of the refrigerator. Never buying again.",true
