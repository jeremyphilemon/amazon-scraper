Very easy to set and forget to enjoy in the morning. At $3 a bag, it is a LITTLE pricey, but I don't see how they could offer this for less and keep it as convenient. All of the flavors have tasted great so far, if you want to eat it warm I would microwave it unless you want the full flavor of protein in your mouth. (not fun) Keeping these as an office staple!

I saw an ad on social media and looked up the product on a popular search engine. All reviews were pretty positive. I saw that Amazon sold the product so I decided to place an order. I make good oats on my own but sometimes I get tired of ""my"" flavor. I have to say I loved each flavor in the combo pack I ordered: blueberry, pancake, bananna, chia. I was pretty sure there was going to be a front runner but I was wrong...each packet was yummy. I used oat ""milk"" to make the meal. I will say that I think this product is kinda pricey (vegan with shacker cup). I wish they had coupons that I could find. I most likely will order agian. Packing and shipping were good and fast.",true

I‚Äôm just a normal person trying to eat healthier and I hate breakfast. I didn‚Äôt want a tasteless, chalky, weird protein source option. I do occasionally drink protein shakes but I have to add Splenda to make them palatable ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. These oat drinks hit the spot! They are sweet enough for normal palates but not so sweet that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The flavors are great and don‚Äôt have any weird chemical or artificial taste. They are filling and keep me full through my mid-morning workout. It is a bit weird to get used to drinking it without chewing but if you can‚Äôt, there are directions for making it as regular oatmeal. These are now my go-to for busy mornings when I‚Äôm getting kids out the door and don‚Äôt have time to make anything for myself.",true
