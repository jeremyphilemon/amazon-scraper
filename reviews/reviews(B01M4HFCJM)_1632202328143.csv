Tastes just as good as Nutella","This is everything I hoped it would be - rich, smooth, thick, chocolatey goodness.Not at all grainy as some other chocolate hazelnut butters are.Probably if you tried it side-by-side with Nutella, you could tell the difference, but I'm not sure...it's awfully close, maybe better!",true
"R1BTZCG6VRLQJB","B01M4HFCJM","","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2021","July 16, 2021",1626415200,"Funklord",4,"Dairy-free options are never THIS good","I did a blind taste test with a couple friends to find a Nutella replacement that didn't use palm oil (for ethics/sustainabilty reasons). The four of us came to a nearly perfect consensus. We didn't directly compare against ""real"" Nutella directly but picked the ones we thought were closest.Surprisingly close to the dairy-full Nocciolata option, just a bit less creamy and sweet than the genuine article. Has a type of sweetness that's unique but we couldn't really put our finger on why. One tester described as having hints of an ice cream ""cake cone"". We noted that this option could have been 100% Vegan except for the sugar used, which was not specifically identified as such.Even though this one came out 4th, it's still delicious and if you're dairy free it's an incredible option. The overall ranking of our five sampled products was:1-Caffarel Hazelnut Creations Cremosa2-Nocciolata w/ Cocoa and milk3-Caffarel Gianduia Cream Hazelnut Spread4-Nocciolata Dairy Free5-Good Galaxy Hazelnutty",true
