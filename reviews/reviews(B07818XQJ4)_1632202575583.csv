But overall, they are really on to something here.Definitely worth a try.",true

Use thick or stir for creamy.","Best thing is the flavor and simple,organic ingredients. I don’t know if they changed their formula because Amazon posted an image of “this product” in different packaging and containing rice maltodextrin. This product in plastic tub purchased at WF only has coconut and the cultures. Super clean tasting slightly sweet with a nice yogurt tang. Super thick creamy like Greek yogurt or almost feta cheese. There is liquid that settles at bottom of container. I like my yogurt thick but I guess you could stir it up and get a more liquid texture if you enjoy your yogurt that way. This product can go great with veggies or fruit. It is slightly sweet snd can substitute excellent for whipped cream. I had it before with fruit. I think the texture came a little smoother. I think it depends on how it settles. To be expected for such a natural artisan type product. This time I used it with tomatoes snd fresh cucumber doused with garlic powder and oregano. It was like eating a Greek salad. It was thick enough could be used on crackers. Yes expensive. I wish it were more like $7.99 but if memory serves it was $10.99. Simply awesome versatile. Maybe in time as sales increase they will lower the price. I think more people would venture to buy and continue buying. I only saw plain available but I’m ok with that as I can add my own fruit. I would say also it can be used in a salad dressing recipe instead of cream or cheese.",false

This is the closest replacement to Greek yogurt I've found, in its slightly sweet and tangy creaminess. (I've tried So Delicious, Culina, CoCoJune, and others). One note--I have to dump it out into a bowl and whisk it to get it to the desired consistency.",true
