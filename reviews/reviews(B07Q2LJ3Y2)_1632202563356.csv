My dad and I just started our own tradition this summer. We're having a really hard time keeping a consistent temp for it to turn out right and then end up going 30 hrs seasonally and then different climates/zones. So I would say a 5 star on everything but we had problems with temp and directions a little bit.... we had a few oops'. Can you use a yogurt maker? Or have you/anyone tried using one?",true
