It's not quite as thick as true Greek yogurt but very close. I use this in my smoothies. It's a great sour cream substitute for non-dairy or vegan lovers. It's even a pretty good sub for cream cheese in some recipes. I keep this on hand. It's great for add-ins too.",true

Itâ€™s hard to describe but itâ€™s a very overpowering taste, itâ€™s like biting sour cardboard. I tried two more tiny bites and couldnâ€™t stomach it. Iâ€™m not picky when it comes to yogurt I usually dress up plain high protein/low sugar yogurt with granola and fruit. I canâ€™t imagine trying to mask this with other foods itâ€™s so strong in the worst way. Donâ€™t waste your money.",false

This is sour and strong. It is, however, delicious when used creatively and the macros are pretty good for a vegan greek yogurt; the protein content per serving is actually comparable to dairy greek yogurt and there's more fiber! Stop eating vegan yogurt that's just sugar with no protein, it's a waste of calories!I use this as a healthy vegan sour cream alternative over chili and it tastes great with the other flavors. I also mix it with a sugar free stevia-based ""maple"" syrup and use it as a decadent pancake topping that tastes like frosting with 0g of sugar. This yogurt is also tasty mixed with chocolate protein powder for a healthy chocolate pudding style breakfast that can be topped with fruits and nuts. Be creative!",false

It is perfectly thick, just like real dairy Greek yogurt, and the taste is very fresh unlike some vegan yogurts that have a strange after taste.Everyone has their own preferences for alternative dairy but I urge you to try this. Itâ€™s amazing and Iâ€™m never going back to anything else. Not to mention it is often on sale at Whole Foods ðŸ¥°",true
