My usual go-to is 0% Fage greek yogurt, but branched out and tried this brand. I was pleasantly surprised! It isn't as thick as Fage, but is still very creamy. The taste is much less tart than most 0% greek yogurt varieties. It mixes very well with berries and sweetener. There is very little moisture that builds up as it sits in the fridge- a common issue with some greek yogurts.I will definitely continue to buy this Stonyfield Greek Yogurt- the price is great for the amount of scrumptious yogurt!",true

It is very grainy and extremely thin for a Greek yogurt, and the flavor is poor. Very much regret my purchase. Go with Siggis, Wallaby, or Fage",true
