I grew up on real full fat yogurt and in America couldn’t find anything that tasted good. But this French yogurt hits the spot! They truly brought French yogurt to America.

We love all 3 flavors, especially with Michele’s granola on top! It’s thick like custard, and does not seem to upset my hubby’s lactose intolerant tummy for some reason.

There I picked this one and a few others. Of all the ones I picked this one was the best!!! So rich! So delicious! So satisfying! So decadent! I’ll be buying more.
