The yogurt is very smooth, slimy but VERY very sweet. The second ingredient on the label is sugar, therefore it contains a significant amount of it. Totalsugar reads 22 grams (32%). That is a huge load of sugar in a tiny cup of yogurt.This is my first and last time purchasing this yogurt and brand.Watch out if you want to eat healthy. This no good as yogurt.",true

I love cream on the top full-fat yogurt, so as soon as I saw this had that, I was sold.I prefer the blueberry best from their fruit yogurts. The strawberry one is great tasting, but unlike the blueberry yogurt where the berries remain firm, like most strawberry yogurts, it tastes more like jam mixed in due to the limp strawberries and the extra sugars released.Still, having tried many yogurts in my life, this one is always in my top two brands. It's creamy consistency is the same as the other brands, so you really can't lose. Plus,it's organic and the taste is real, not fake.",true
