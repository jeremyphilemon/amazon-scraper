I have never had a yogurt taste so creamy and delicious, and the peach flavor is one of my favorites for sure. This yogurt tastes super natural, none of the artificial ""health"" that a lot of the yogurt companies are trying out right now. It's about 300 calories per cup, and is about twice the size of the standard greek cup at the grocery store (I split mine into two small servings). Excellent with granola, my other favorites are lemon and mango.",false

Nice work, you environmental monsters. The contained yoghurt is thoroughly mediocre. At least in my area we have much better yogurts for lower prices. Not that any sane person would by yogurt on Amazon.",false

(which it does say-making the contents slightly less than the 4oz stated) and the one bought in my store is 4-1/2oz on the package but actually came in at 4-3/4oz without the lid so I have to assume it has slightly more than stated in the container.",true

I am now a devoted fan and eat Noosa Yogurt for breakfast every day.I actually look forward to it every morning.Highly recommend it ... the Strawberry Rhubarb is 5 Stars !",false
