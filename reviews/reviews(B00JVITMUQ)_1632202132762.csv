Johns",3,"Do not trust Delivery","The bunnies had a nice flavor but we're melted together in the bag and very sticky, which surprised me since I ordered them during the winter season, the main issue I had thought was the time it took to receive the item which was well over a month even though when I placed the order the expected delivery was in two days.",true

I hate that they are stuck together and your hands get sticky every time you pull one out of the bag. The taste reminds of those jellies they put inside a boba tea drink. Great in boba tea, but not so great by itself. I think the aftertaste comes from the organic tapioca syrup and organic color (black carrot and blackcurrant).The good is that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup and it's 70 calories for each individual bag. It's $6.98 for 12 pouches when you get it through Amazon Fresh. I guess it's okay for a healthy snack. It's still in the pantry, and I bought them when we first started getting deliveries for covid-19 a month ago. Let's just say it's good when I want something sweet that's not a billion calories.",true
