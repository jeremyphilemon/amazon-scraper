So I came across this starter and decided to give yogurt making a try. It the end product tastes exactly like the brand I use to get and that brings my family and I so much joy! We add a little strawberry or blueberry jam right before eating to make it taste identical to the flavor I use to buy. I'd also like to say the shelf life of it is amazing as well, I found some packets in the cupboard I forgot to use from the beginning of 2019 and they still worked perfectly.",true

Instructions included!!","This starter is awesome. They don't sell this Bulgarian yogurt where I live, and it's amazing.I'm on my third generation, now and it's still as awesome as the first batch. I've learned how to incubate it in my Ninja Foodi Grill on the dehydrate function at 105°F.It's amazing!!!!! I use one half gallon whole milk, heat it to 185°F, remove from heat until the milk cools to 110°F. I mix in the starter sachet with a whisk and whisk it by hand for 30 seconds. Then I transfer it to eight 8 fluid ounce glass jars and put them into the Foodi Grill on the dehydrate setting at 105°F for 10 hours. PERFECT YOGURT - in containers, ready to freeze. (Freezing it keeps you from being able to eat all your yogurt in one day, which is exactly what I did with my first quart batch I made!!!) I hope you have the same luck I've had so far!!!!",true
