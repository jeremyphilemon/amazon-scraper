I've used mine to make yogurt and it has come out great. Of course, soy yogurt isn't as firm as dairy yogurt but that's fine for my uses. The cook in the video poured the soy milk in the instant pot. Then he poured the starter in and stirred it. He closed the pot and set the time in the yogurt setting. When the time was up he had perfect yogurt. So I tried it and sure enough the yogurt came out exactly the same. No heating the milk, waiting for cool down, stirring in the starter. Next time I'm going to mix it right into the mason jar (which I've also seen done). No water to add to the pot. The jar goes directly in with the lid loose. How easy is that?! No Instant pot to clean. Just what ever I stir the starter into the soy milk goes right in the dishwasher. I give my yogurt a full 24 hours because I like the tart flavor. This is also the least expensive, reliable starter I've found.",true
