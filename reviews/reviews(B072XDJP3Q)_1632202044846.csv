I tried to eat them and literally gagged! I was used to ordering ""Sincerely Nuts"" dried apricots...and thought I would try some other kinds. BIG MISTAKE! I only like California apricots not the Turkish kind which I find tasteless and too sweet. I like the sharpness of the higher vitamin C content of California dried apricots. Some of the apricots in a handful from this box didn't even taste vaguely like apricots, others tasted only of chemicals! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE AT ALL!!",true

Trader Joe's carried Blenheim variety for as long as I can remember but wanted to try this variety. Good product and quality but not quite as flavorful and tangy as I had hoped.
