"R2KZUJTOX00P79","B08BJX2JDH","","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021","March 10, 2021",1615359600,"ilovetea!",3,"would be 5 stars if they take out the stevia","Overall I liked this yogurt however the reason for the less than five stars is because it has Stevia in it.Why are they putting this in so many food lines.The yogurt tasted good at first, until that signature Stevia aftertaste took over.I looked at the package and saw not only stevia but monkfruit as well.I've never had Monkfruit on its own so I have no idea what that tastes like but the Stevia is a dealbreaker for me.I added honey and that for me made it edible so that I could finish this yogurt. It did satisfy my hunger and was creamy. So kudos there!",true

Lactose free, high in protein, low in sugar but still delicious!How often does that happen?I add fresh fruit to it, when I need something to take care of my sweet tooth I add a tiny bit of Stevia....yummmmm!",true

I only buy Chobani yogurt, for years -But this is even better because it is lactose free! Thanks Chobani. As with all Chibanis, no added sugar, no added junk or preservatives, etc. I can't think of reason anyone would buy any other brand. Could use a little more fruit (I add my own), but no less than any other brands. btw-""Complete"" is 20 to 50 cents more than regular, if not on sale, but worth it to me.",true
