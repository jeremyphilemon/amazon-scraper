This isn’t healthy treat.There’s as much refined sugar as ice cream, and the word “yogurt” will never change that.…BUT totally worth it. If you like yogurt, coconut, almond, and/or dark chocolate without a distaste for the other “or”s, fantastic treat for any time of day in which a treat is due.",true

They’re similar to other yogurts with same toppings so I just buy whichever is on sale. I like that these are smaller than the noosa, as too much gets cloying for me.",false

The add-ins are great. I use this to satisfy my chocolate craving. Definitely not low-calorie but much less than ice cream of candy bars.
