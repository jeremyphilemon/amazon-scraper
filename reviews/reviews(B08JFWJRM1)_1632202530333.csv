This yogurt is definitely one of the closest tastingto real yogurt that I have tried. Frankly, it’s better than the coconut yogurt, and almond yogurt alternatives. The first note is slight chalky, but then it is smooth, and rich, and quite delicious. Also love the fruit on the bottom feature (which is missing from most alternative yogurts).",true

The not-so-good: It's a very, very light taste. Almost like, a faint whiff of strawberry, so that the oat taste really penetrates through and overpowers it for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for over the top artificial strawberry-ness in my yogurt, but I do think this product would be greatly improved if the strawberry flavor was amped up a bit. Right now, it reminds me of the taste of strawberry bubble gum that you've already chewed for an hour. All that being said, the texture is super promising. It definitely could benefit from being jazzed up with some fresh fruit, nuts, granola...but on its own, its just not jiving for me.",true

Very light flavor, almost reminiscent of bubble gum but in a good way. Only downside is there isn't a ton of protein but add some nuts or mix to it and you're good to go!",true
