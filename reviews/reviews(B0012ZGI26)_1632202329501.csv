There’s no way anyone could eat that much honey with that much yogurt. I don’t like to buy products that make me feel like a glutton and a wasteful Amercican. Next time I will be a large container of this yogurt and some honey separate and mix them myself.",true

The slight tart of the plain greek yogurt with the sweet and delicious honey is the perfect contrast. I recommend not stirring it like crazy and mixing it. Just push the honey into the yogurt a few times or leave it layered on top. So good.",true

Don't blend in the honey!","It tastes better when the honey is lightly added to the yogurt, but not blended/fully mixed in. I'm not sure why, but maybe it's the slight texture difference and having a pockets of sweetness instead of a mush of sweetness.",true
