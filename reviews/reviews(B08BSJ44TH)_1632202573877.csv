It doesn’t have a coconut taste. The consistency is like regular dairy yogurt (not Greek yogurt). I was able to use it in both sweet and savory dishes. And for someone who is sensitive to so many ingredients, this was a real winner for me.",true

They are either totally moldy with black mold, pink mold, and even white fuzzy mold. I have purchased tons of yogurts in my life and have never experienced something like this and so consistently. It is literally at least every other container or sometimes every container. Unfortunately something is not right with these. It’s beyond disgusting and so unsafe.",true
