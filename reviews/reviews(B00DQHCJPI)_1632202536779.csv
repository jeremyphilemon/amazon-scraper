"R27H0GIP3JJT85","B00DQHCJPI","","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2016","September 5, 2016",1473055200,"Lazy Shopper",5,"Delicious - one of the best always-available Siggi's flavors","There are only three Siggi's yogurts that I buy:this one, the Coconut, and the Vanilla Cardamom, which is delicious but not always available.All three are made with cane sugar.One expects raspberry yogurt to be a little bit tart, so Siggi's reduced sugar formula works well here.I prefer it to any other raspberry yogurt.Many of the other flavors are lackluster, and the Vanilla and some others are flavored with agave ""nectar,"" a highly-processed sweetener that tastes unpleasant and contains more fructose than high-fructose corn syrup.(The Smari vanilla skyr tastes much, much better.) According to the NIH, agave causes elevated triglyceride levels, insulin resistance, and leptin resistance, which promotes obesity.My preference is to buy Siggi's by the 12-container case.When I do this at my local supermarket, the market gives me a discount, the foil tops of the containers are unpunctured when I get them home, and the cases store neatly in my refrigerator.When Amazon tags Siggi's at $1.25 per container, they match my supermarket's price.Unfortunately, however, Amazon doesn't want to deliver the Siggi's containers in the producer's original case packaging or repackage them in an appropriate way.As a result, when I receive a Fresh delivery, the Siggi's containers are always jumbled together in a plastic bag and at least several tops are broken.From time to time, I even find that one or two of the plastic containers have split.If Amazon can't find a better way to handle Siggi's, they should at least be willing to sell this product in Siggi's original cases.",false
