      "UNRELIABLE I discovered this brand, first at Himalayan Institute PA. The yogurt is tangy ( how everyone outside United States, believes the yogurt should be) and Smooth. So good that I had to go to the kitchen and ask what starter they use. I ordered it and for a whole year, I had the most amazing yogurt. Easy, economical, tart, perfect consistency. Much btter than The European Yogurt you buy at Trader Joe's.I ordered it again the next year from the same Amazon distributor. Not a single one in the package worked! And I hopelessly tried to experiment with increasing the incubation time, the cooling time, mixing two packagage... Not a single one worked. I feel that if there was a possibility to buy the product from the company itself rather than Amazon, the issue could have been resolved. But it is not possible. Or... Is it just an unreliable company? I am very disappointed. \n",

The texture is clumpy not creamy like the plain one, the vanilla taste is weird, it’s like they add monk fruit or stevia to it but it’s not listed as so.Not a fan at all and would not purchase again. I will continue to just mix vanilla in with the plain. \n",
